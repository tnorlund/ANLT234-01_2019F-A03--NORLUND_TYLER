*Does the Tomato Meter Mean a successful Movie?*

Movie reviews can determine whether the viewer will spend their money at the movie theater.

---

I started my career in the movie industry, and I learned that it is competitive, expensive, and full of people that are full of themselves. With this level of stress, I found it difficult to work, and I cannot imagine how bad it is today. Today, studios are not only making more money on successful movies, but they are also losing more money on the "flops" they chose not to see coming. Can movie reviews help the industry figure out which movies will be successful? 

In order to explore the data, I started with [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/). This is a great website that uses data from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/). Using this website, I was able to scrape all the data from each [weekend box office](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/?ref_=bo_nb_di_secondarytab) from 2000 to the current day.  The domestic data obtained here was:
 - Weekend date
 - How much money the top 10 grossing movies made
 - How much money all of the movies grossed
 - The number of new releases 
 - The highest grossing movie 

So let's first look at how the movie industry's grossing has changed over the years.

It looks like the best movies have been consistently grossing more money since 2000. It might be messy, but if we look at all the best movie grosses on a single graph we can find some patterns.

Here, we see that at the end of August, movies are less likely to do successfully. We also can see that Avengers Endgame is the most successful movie of all time, grossing $357,115,007 it's opening [weekend](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt4154796/?ref_=bo_se_r_2) (I don't know why people like this movie).
