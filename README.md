*The Failure of School?*

When people pay for school they have the opportunity to succeed. When the school can no longer pay for itself, the school not only fails itself, but the school also fails its students.

## Plot 

An expert states that "25% of schools will fail in the next 20 years." [link](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/expert-predicts-25-percent-of-colleges-will-fail-in-the-next-20-years-2019-08-31/)

"Energy flows where focus goes."

"Price of College Increasing 8 times faster than wages" [link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#4fe7bcd266c1)[graph](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fcamilomaldonado%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F07%2F2018.07.23-Student-Loans-Forbes.001-1200x876.jpg)


## Twists 

More people are entering and graduating public high schools.
	- Costs of public school are increasing overtime with no difference in test scores [link](https://www.cato.org/blog/public-school-spending-theres-chart)

College enrollment is 5% lower this semester than the previous year. 

College enrollment peaked in Fall 2010. [link](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372)

## Ending Statement

With more people requiring higher paying jobs, how will student enrollment be affected?


## Research Plan 

I have a couple sources, but I could use more.
	- Look at how different areas are doing
	- Compare cost of school with graduation
	- Look for data on graduate income

I plan on getting more sources online. 

I plan on producing graphs to reflect my conclusion once I find one.
